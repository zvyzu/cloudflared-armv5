# Build Workflow Setup - Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to enable easy triggering and validation of the build.yml workflow.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation (README.md)
- Added comprehensive documentation about the project
- Documented three methods to trigger the build workflow:
  - GitHub Web UI
  - GitHub CLI
  - GitHub API (curl)
- Documented the build process and requirements
- Listed required secrets for the workflow
- Added usage instructions for the Docker image

### 2. Trigger Helper Script (trigger-build.sh)
- Created a convenient script to trigger the workflow using GitHub CLI
- Includes checks for gh CLI installation and authentication
- Provides helpful error messages and next steps
- Made executable with proper permissions

### 3. Validation Script (validate-workflow.sh)
- Created a comprehensive validation script to check all prerequisites
- Validates:
  - Python installation and required modules
  - Workflow YAML syntax
  - Required files existence
  - Build script permissions
  - Dockerfile syntax
  - Workflow configuration
- Provides clear status messages and troubleshooting hints
- Made executable with proper permissions

### 4. Build Script Permissions (build-cloudflared-armv5.sh)
- Made the build script executable (chmod +x)
- Ensures it can be run directly from the workflow

## How to Use

### Trigger the Workflow

Choose one of these methods:

1. **GitHub Web UI** (easiest):
   - Go to https://github.com/zvyzu/cloudflared-armv5/actions
   - Select "Check for Cloudflared Releases and Build Docker Image"
   - Click "Run workflow"

2. **Using the helper script**:
   ```bash
   ./trigger-build.sh
   ```

3. **Using GitHub CLI directly**:
   ```bash
   gh workflow run build.yml
   ```

### Validate Prerequisites

Before triggering the workflow, you can validate that everything is configured correctly:

```bash
./validate-workflow.sh
```

This will check all prerequisites and provide clear feedback about any issues.

## Workflow Capabilities

The build.yml workflow will:
1. Check for new cloudflared releases
2. Build a custom Go toolchain for ARMv5 (if new version found)
3. Build Docker image for ARMv5 architecture
4. Push to Docker Hub (vyzu/cloudflared-armv5)
5. Update latest_version.txt in the repository
6. Create a GitHub release and tag

## Required Secrets

The workflow requires these repository secrets to be configured:
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Docker Hub username
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Docker Hub access token
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

## Next Steps

The workflow is now ready to run! You can:
1. Trigger it manually using any of the methods above
2. Wait for the scheduled daily run (midnight UTC)
3. It will automatically detect and build new cloudflared releases
